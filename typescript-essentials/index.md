## Reflections

In general the course is good!

1. **Getting Started with TypeScript**: I familiarized myself with TypeScript basics.
2. **Declare Variable Types in TypeScript**: I learnt how to declare variable types in TypeScript.
3. **Implement Interfaces in TypeScript**: I got understanding and practical skills in using interfaces for structuring complex data types.
4. **Develop Typed Functions in TypeScript**: The aim to solidify my understanding and application of TypeScript's type system in the context of function development was achieved.
